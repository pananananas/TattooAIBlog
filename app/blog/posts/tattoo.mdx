Tattoos have been a form of self-expression for thousands of years, serving as a medium for people to tell their stories, display their beliefs, or simply showcase their creativity. In the past decade, we've witnessed a remarkable surge in the popularity and societal acceptance of tattoos.

In this post we wanted to dive deeper into this phenomenon. Our goal was to explore which tattoo styles are currently trending, understand people's perceptions of tattoos, and uncover the most common designs that people choose to print on their skin. 


## Data Collection

We decided to focus on Reddit as our primary data source, as it is a popular platform for tattoo enthusiasts to share their work, seek advice, and discuss the latest trends.

We collected a massive dataset from four of the most popular tattoo-related subreddits: 
**r/Tattoo ,** **r/Tattoos**, **r/TattooDesigns**, and **r/TattooAdvice**. This dataset spans over ten years and includes `55,000` posts, which provided us with approximately `80,000` images and `3.5` million comments.

Here are some samples of the images we collected:

  <CardStack id="card-stack-tattoo-1" displayLabels={false}/>
</div>


For purpose our analysis, we focused on nine prominent tattoo styles, and examined how frequently they appeared in the images shared by users.

## Method

To conduct a thorough analysis of tattoos, we employed a multimodal approach using the Qwen2VL model for: description generation, style and color identification from the images. This model enabled us to extract detailed descriptions and accurately categorize present tattoo styles . 

To ensure the accuracy of our findings, we annotated a validation set consisting of 100 images. Our performance metrics were impressive, with an **F1 score** of `0.82` for style classification, `0.88` for color identification, and an `88`% accuracy for extracting keywords from image descriptions.

In addition to the image-based analysis, we also explored the textual descriptions. Our focus was on three key aspects:

- Popularity of styles ‚Äì we used statistical methods to analyze how frequently different styles appeared over time.

- Sentiment in regards to styles  ‚Äì we used the **RoBERTa** model to capture positive or negative opinions expressed by the community about each tattoo style.

- Themes of the tattoos ‚Äì using BERTopic for topic modeling, allowed us to uncover the most common subjects and motifs featured in tattoo designs.

Here is out pipeline, represented visually:

## Tattoo styles popularity

Once we labeled our entire dataset, we analyzed the frequency of each style over time. This allowed us to identify trends and shifts in popularity, providing valuable insights into how the tattoo landscape has evolved.

Tattoo art has been steadily gaining popularity over the years. 
The chart reveals that the Illustrative style has consistently been the most popular.

In 2022, an interesting shift occurred when the Blackwork style surpassed Traditional, becoming the third most frequently discussed tattoo style online. Other styles like Realism and Minimalist are also showing gradual growth in popularity.

It's worth noting the decline in the number of posts during the **COVID-19** pandemic, likely due to restrictions and reduced tattoo appointments, but the numbers have rebounded strongly since then.

The another decline accured in mid 2023. As far as we know it was due to the Imgur policy changes, which resulted in the deletion of many images from the platform. This affected the availability of images for our analysis, leading to a temporary decrease in the number of posts.

## Sentiment analysis

Using the **RoBERTa** model, we conducted a sentiment analysis of comments to evaluate the perception of various tattoo styles.

Calligraphy tattoos had the lowest sentiment scores, suggesting they may be more polarizing or subject to critical opinions.

Trash Polka, known for its bold and unconventional aesthetic, displayed the highest variability in sentiment, reflecting a diverse range of opinions.

The most popular tattoo styles, such as illustrative and traditional designs, received the most consistent and stable feedback, indicating their broad acceptance within the community.

Our analysis also showed a concerning trend: the overall sentiment in comments has been declining over time. 


## Topic modeling
Topic modeling offers a powerful way to analyze trends and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets. In our study, the goal was to identify the key themes present in tattoo designs and analyze their popularity over time. Leveraging the **BERTopic** model, we conducted an in-depth analysis of visual descriptions generated by the Qwen2VL model. This method allowed us to discover, classify, and explore the monthly dynamics of different tattoo motifs.

One of the most prominent findings was the dominance of the cat motif üêà, which experienced a significant rise in popularity starting in 2021. This theme has continued to hold the top spot in recent years. Similarly, the butterfly motif ü¶ã saw a dramatic surge, climbing from the least popular theme to becoming the second most favored design during 2022.

In addition to animals, other recurring popular themes included flowers and leaves üå∏, landscapes, and anime characters. These results not only highlight the diverse interests of tattoo enthusiasts but also reflect broader cultural and aesthetic shifts.

## Conclusion

Based on an exploratory analysis of Tattoo art, we note an increase in its interest over the years. Users are increasingly willing to publish their designs and completed tattoos on the Reddit platform. However, with the increase in popularity, we observe a general decline in the overtones of comments, affecting each style individually.
